# Detection of Signal in Noise

This repo is a collection of my homework assignments and some notes for ECE4688 at Northeastern University.

## 
Topics so far: 
+ Maximum Likelihood Detection 
+ Maximum A-Priori Detection
+ Bayes' Classification
+ Neuman-Pearson 
+ Mini-Max criterion.

Most notebooks are in Matlab/Octave as this is the language required, however I am trying to duplicate my work in Julia as well, as I think it is a terrific language.

### This Course is in progress!
Watch this repo for updates by the week.
