# Detection of Signal in Noise

This repo is a collection of my homework assignments and some notes for ECE4688 at Northeastern University.

## Topics so far: 
+ Detection
	+ Maximum Likelihood Detection 
	+ Maximum A-Priori Detection
	+ Bayes' Classification
	+ Neuman-Pearson 
	+ Mini-Max criterion.
+ Unknown Parameters / Estimation
	+ UMP - Uniformly Most Powerful test
	+ Least Favorable Distributions
	+ ML Estimation
	+ MVUB Estimation
	+ ABS estimation
	+ MAP Estimation (MMSE)
	+ Linear MMSE

Most notebooks are in Matlab/Octave as this is the language required, however I am trying to duplicate my work in Julia as well, as I think it is a terrific language.

### This Course is in progress!
Watch this repo for updates by the week.
