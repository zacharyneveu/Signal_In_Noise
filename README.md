# Detection of Signal in Noise

This repo is a collection of my homework assignments for ECE4688 at Northeastern University.

Topics so far include Maximum Likelihood Detection, Maximum A-Priori Detection, Bayes' Classification, Neuman-Pearson, and the Mini-Max criterion.

Most notebooks are in Matlab/Octave as this is the language required, however I am trying to duplicate my work in Julia as well, as I think it is a terrific language.
